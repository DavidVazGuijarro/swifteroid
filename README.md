# swifteroid

Swifteroid is a Photo Application written in Swift in which the exposure button is mapped to the HDR function aka. bracketing on DSLR cameras. The longer the exposure button is pressed by the user the bigger the bracketing of the exposure will be. This is usefull when a very large dynamic of a picture is needed. Extreme dark and extreme bright spots in the same picture.

Swifteroid is currently written in Swift 2.0 Beta and will not build on Swift 1.2.
